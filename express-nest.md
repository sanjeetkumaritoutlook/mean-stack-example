Express.js and NestJS are related, but not the same.

##🔹 Express.js

A minimal, unopinionated Node.js web framework.

Gives you full freedom → you decide project structure, middleware, routing, etc.

Very flexible, but you must handle architecture and patterns yourself.

Great for small to medium apps or when you want total control.

Example (Express):

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```
##🔹 NestJS

A framework built on top of Express (or Fastify).

Comes with a strong opinionated architecture (modules, controllers, services).

Provides dependency injection, decorators, and built-in patterns for testing, security, microservices, etc.

Ideal for large-scale, enterprise apps where structure and scalability matter.

Example (NestJS):
```
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('hello')
export class HelloController {
  @Get()
  getHello(): string {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }
}
```
NestJS is not a replacement for Express — it sits on top of Express (or Fastify) and provides a higher-level framework.

🔹 How NestJS Uses Express Internally

When you bootstrap a NestJS app:
```
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule); // <-- Uses Express by default
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```
👉 Here NestFactory.create() spins up a Nest application using Express as the underlying HTTP server.
🔹 Internals

By default, Nest wraps an Express app instance.

Every @Controller you create in Nest is internally mapped to Express routes.

Example:
```
@Controller('hello')
export class HelloController {
  @Get()
  getHello() {
    return 'Hello World';
  }
}
```
is internally equivalent to:
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});
```
🔹 Switching from Express → Fastify

Nest is flexible: you can swap the underlying HTTP platform.
```
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { FastifyAdapter } from '@nestjs/platform-fastify';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule, new FastifyAdapter()); 
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```
👉 Now Nest runs on Fastify instead of Express, without changing your controllers.


## Node.js

Not a framework — it’s a runtime environment.

Allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser (on servers).

Built on Chrome’s V8 engine + libuv (for async I/O).

Provides APIs like http, fs, path → so you can build servers, file systems, etc.

👉 Without Node.js, you wouldn’t be able to run Express or Nest on the server.

## 🔹 Express.js

A web framework for Node.js.

Simplifies handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware.

Sits on top of Node’s http module.

Still lightweight — you must design the app structure yourself.

👉 Express = “thin layer” over Node’s http.

## 🔹 NestJS

A higher-level framework built on top of Express (or Fastify).

Provides a structured architecture (controllers, modules, DI).

Uses Express under the hood (by default) → which itself runs on Node.js.

## 🔹 Key Features of NestJS

Modular architecture → Applications are divided into modules (easy to scale & maintain).

Dependency Injection (DI) → Manages how classes and services are connected.

TypeScript-first → Strong typing, decorators (@Controller, @Injectable, etc.).

Built-in support for:

REST APIs

GraphQL

WebSockets

Microservices (Kafka, gRPC, MQTT, etc.)

Middleware, Pipes, Guards, Interceptors → For request validation, security, and logging.

##🔹 Why Developers Use NestJS

Scalable → Great for enterprise apps and microservices.

Structured → Enforces clean, testable code.

Familiar for Angular devs → Similar patterns.

Ecosystem-friendly → Works with TypeORM, Mongoose, Passport.js, etc.

## In short:

Node.js = Runtime (foundation).

Express = Framework on Node (routing & middleware).

NestJS = Framework built on Express (or Fastify) with extra architecture for large apps.

👉 If you’re building small APIs, Express is enough.

👉 If you’re building enterprise-scale apps with teams, NestJS gives you structure.
## ✅ Summary

NestJS = Abstraction Layer on top of Express (default) or Fastify.

Your code (controllers, services, modules) → mapped to Express routes & middleware under the hood.

This gives you all Express power + extra structure & features like Dependency Injection, Pipes, Guards, etc.
