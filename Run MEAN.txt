--------

MongoDB—document database  (noSQL) - key value pair- JSON- opposite of relation db
Express—a Node.js framework for building APIs
Angular—front-end application framework
Node.js—server-side JavaScript runtime environment
---------------
In a MEAN stack, the server-side is typically managed using Node.js with Express.js. 

to run server:
npx ts-node src/server.ts

http://localhost:3000/employees
This will call the /employees endpoint and should return the list of employees if the database is populated.
•	Ensure that MongoDB is running locally or is properly connected to your cloud database.

local MongoDB instance
mongodb://localhost:27017
-----
Important Note
The port 5200 is for HTTP requests (frontend ↔ backend). -->Expressjs
The port 27017 is for database communication (backend ↔ MongoDB).
Both ports are unrelated, so there’s no conflict.
